# Protobuf Format

[Message](/docs/cloud/s3/messages) is encoded using [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) schema and compressed with
[lz4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) utility.

[Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) schema corresponds to the stream ( folder in [bucket](/docs/cloud/s3/buckets) ).
Refer to the below sections for the exact mapping of different types of the blockchain.

Github project [streaming_protobuf](https://github.com/bitquery/streaming_protobuf)
contains the schema for the streams.
