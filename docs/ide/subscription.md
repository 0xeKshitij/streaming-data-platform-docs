# Subscriptions

The IDE supports real-time subscriptions, allowing us to get results instantly.

> Query used: [Real Time Blocks Subscription | BSC](https://graphql.bitquery.io/ide/Real-Time-Blocks-Subscription--BSC)

Once you click on the "Play" button, you are initiating a real-time query of the data. If you want to pause this, you can click on the button again. 

Additionally, you may be able to see the refresh seconds or intervals in the IDE. 

Read more about how to use subscription and websockets [here](/docs/graphql/subscription/subscription.md).

:::caution Resources usage

Please note that as long as data is being received, the box on the right will continue to populate, which has no text limit, so make sure you don't waste your resources!
