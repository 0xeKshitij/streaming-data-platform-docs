# Solana Transactions API

In this section we'll have a look at some examples using the Solana Transactions API.
This Solana API is part of our Early Access Program (EAP), which is intended for evaluation purposes.
This program allows you to test the data and its integration into your applications before full-scale implementation. Read more [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/graphql/dataset/EAP/)

# Subscribe to Recent Transactions

The subscription query below fetches the most recent transactions on the Solana blockchain
You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Realtime-Solana-Transactions)

```
subscription {
  Solana {
    Transactions(limit: {count: 10}) {
      Block {
        Time
        Hash
      }
      Transaction {
