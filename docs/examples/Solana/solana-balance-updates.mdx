# Solana Balance & Balance Updates API

In thise section we will see how to monitor real-time balance changes across the Solana blockchain

This Solana API is part of our Early Access Program (EAP), which is intended for evaluation purposes.This program allows you to test the data and its integration into your applications before full-scale implementation. Read more [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/graphql/dataset/EAP/)

## Get Latest Balance Updates

The query will subscribe you to real-time updates for balance changes on the Solana blockchain, providing a continuous stream of data as new transactions are processed and recorded.
You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Solana-Balance-Updates)

```
subscription {
  Solana {
    InstructionBalanceUpdates(limit: {count: 10}) {
      Transaction {
        Index
        FeePayer
        Fee
        Signature
        Result {
          Success
          ErrorMessage
        }
      }
      Instruction {
        InternalSeqNumber
        Index
        CallPath
        Program {
          Address
