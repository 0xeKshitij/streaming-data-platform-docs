# Solana Jupiter API

In this section, we'll show you how to access information about Jupiter data using Bitquery APIs.

This Solana API is part of our Early Access Program (EAP).

You can use this program to try out the data and see how it works with your applications before you fully integrate it. You can learn more about this [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/graphql/dataset/EAP/).

## Latest Swaps on Jupiter

To retrieve the newest swaps happened on Jupiter Aggregator, we will utilize the Solana instructions API/Websocket.

We will specifically look for the latest instructions from Jupiter's program, identified by the program ID `JUP6LkbZbjS1jKKwapdHNy74zcZ3tLUZoi5QNyVTaV4`.Â 
Whenever a new swap is on Jupiter, it triggers the `sharedAccountsRoute` instructions. The tokens involved in the swap and adderesses to which tokens belong initially and the accounts involved in the route of the swap can be obtained from the Instructions API.

For instance, Index 7 and 8 represent the tokens A and B respectively involved in the swap, while Index 1 and 2 are the addresses to which the tokens B and A belong initially. Note that the indexing starts from 0.

You can run this query using this [link](https://ide.bitquery.io/Tokens-involved-in-Jupiter-swap-source-address-destination-address-DEX-involved_2#).

```graphql
subscription {
  Solana {
    Instructions(
      where: {
        Instruction: {
          Program: {
            Address: { is: "JUP6LkbZbjS1jKKwapdHNy74zcZ3tLUZoi5QNyVTaV4" }
            Method: { is: "sharedAccountsRoute" }
          }
        }
        Transaction: { Result: { Success: true } }
      }
    ) {
      Transaction {
        Signature
      }
      Instruction {
        Program {
          Method
          AccountNames
          Address
        }
        Accounts {

          IsWritable
          Token {
            Mint

            ProgramId
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
