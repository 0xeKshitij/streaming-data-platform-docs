# DEXScreener Solana Data

This section will guide you through different APIs which will tell you how to get data like realtime trades just like how DEXScreener shows for Solana.

import VideoPlayer from "../../../../src/components/videoplayer.js";

## Get Trade Transactions for a particular pair in realtime

The query will subscribe you to real-time trade transactions for a Solana pair, providing a continuous stream of data as new trades are processed and recorded.
You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Get-Solana-pair-trades-data-just-like-dexcsreener#)

```
subscription MyQuery {
  Solana {
    DEXTradeByTokens(
      where: {Trade: {Currency: {MintAddress: {is: "3B5wuUrMEi5yATD7on46hKfej3pfmd7t1RKgrsN3pump"}}, Side: {Currency: {MintAddress: {is: "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"}}}, Dex: {ProgramAddress: {is: "675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8"}}}, Transaction: {Result: {Success: true}}}
    ) {
      Block {
        Time
      }
      Trade {
        Currency {
          Name
          Symbol
        }
        Amount
        PriceAgainstSideCurrency: Price
        PriceInUSD
        Side {
          Currency {
            Name
            Symbol
          }
          Amount
          Type
        }
      }
      Transaction {
        Maker: Signer
        Signature
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Get Top Pairs on Solana

The query will give the top 10 pairs on Solana network in descending order of their total trades happened in their pools in last 1 hour. This query will get you all the data you need such as total trades, total buys, total sells, total traded volume, total buy volume
Please change the `Block: {Time: {since: "2024-08-15T04:19:00Z"}}` accordingly when you try out the query.
Keep in mind you cannot use this as a websocket subscription becuase aggregate functions like `sum` doesn't work well in `subscription`.
You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Dexscreener--All-in-One-query_1)

```
query MyQuery {
  Solana {
    DEXTradeByTokens(
      where: {Transaction: {Result: {Success: true}}, Trade: {Side: {Currency: {MintAddress: {is: "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"}}}}, Block: {Time: {since: "2024-08-15T04:19:00Z"}}}
      orderBy: {descendingByField: "total_trades"}
      limit: {count: 10}
    ) {
      Trade {
        Currency {
          Name
          MintAddress
          Symbol
        }
        start: PriceInUSD(minimum: Block_Time)
        min5: PriceInUSD(
          minimum: Block_Time
          if: {Block: {Time: {after: "2024-08-15T05:14:00Z"}}}
        )
        end: PriceInUSD(maximum: Block_Time)
        Dex {
          ProtocolName
          ProtocolFamily
          ProgramAddress
        }
        Market {
          MarketAddress
        }
        Side {
          Currency {
            Symbol
            Name
            MintAddress
          }
        }
      }
      makers: count(distinct:Transaction_Signer)
      total_trades: count
      total_traded_volume: sum(of: Trade_Side_AmountInUSD)
      total_buy_volume: sum(
        of: Trade_Side_AmountInUSD
        if: {Trade: {Side: {Type: {is: buy}}}}
      )
      total_sell_volume: sum(
        of: Trade_Side_AmountInUSD
        if: {Trade: {Side: {Type: {is: sell}}}}
      )
      total_buys: count(if: {Trade: {Side: {Type: {is: buy}}}})
      total_sells: count(if: {Trade: {Side: {Type: {is: sell}}}})
    }
  }
}
