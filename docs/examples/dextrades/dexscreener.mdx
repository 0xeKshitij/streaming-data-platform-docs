# Use Bitquery API to get all types of DEXScreener Data

This section will guide you through different APIs which will tell you how to get data like realtime trades, price of a token, buys, sells, sell volume, makers, top holders of a token, liquidity of a pair and many more just like how DEXScreener shows.

import VideoPlayer from "../../../src/components/videoplayer.js";

## Get Trade Transactions for a particular pair in realtime

The query will subscribe you to real-time trade transactions for a pair, providing a continuous stream of data as new trades are processed and recorded.
You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Get-pair-trades-data-just-like-dexcsreener)

```
subscription{
  EVM(network: eth) {
    DEXTradeByTokens(
      orderBy: {ascending: Block_Time}
      where: {Trade: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0x382ea807A61a418479318Efd96F1EFbC5c1F2C21"}}, Side: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"}}}}}
    ) {
      Block{
        Time
      }
      Trade {
        Amount
        Currency {
          Symbol
        }
        PriceInUSD
        Dex {
          ProtocolName
          SmartContract
        }
        Side {
          Amount
          AmountInUSD
          Currency {
            Symbol
          }
          Buyer
          Seller
        }
        Buyer
        Seller
      }
      Transaction {
        Maker: From
        Hash
        Type
      }
    }
  }
}


```

## Get Price of a Token

This query will give you the latest Price of a specified token using DEXTrades API. Here we have calculated the price of a token in USD and also against the sell currency. Here is the [saved query link](https://ide.bitquery.io/Price-of-a-token-in-realtime)

```
query MyQuery {
  EVM(network: eth, dataset: realtime) {
    DEXTrades(
      limit: {count: 1}
      orderBy: {descending: Block_Time}
      where: {Trade: {Buy: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0xaaeE1A9723aaDB7afA2810263653A34bA2C21C7a"}}}, Sell: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"}}}, Dex: {Pair: {SmartContract: {is: "0xc2eaB7d33d3cB97692eCB231A5D0e4A649Cb539d"}}}}, TransactionStatus: {Success: true}}
    ) {
      Trade {
        Buy {
          Currency {
            Symbol
          }
          Price_In_USD: PriceInUSD
          Price_against_sell_currency: Price
        }
        Sell {
          Currency {
            Symbol
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}


```

## Get Liquidity of a specific pair by using its Pair Address

The below query finds the liquidity of a pool using the pool address `0xc2eaB7d33d3cB97692eCB231A5D0e4A649Cb539d`. With this query we can get balance of the pool tokens. And to get the USD Liquidity you can multiply the balances of both the tokens to their respective USD prices and then sum it up.

You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Get-liquidity-of-a-pair_1)

```
query MyQuery {
  EVM(dataset: archive, network: eth) {
    BalanceUpdates(
      where: {BalanceUpdate: {Address: {is: "0xc2eaB7d33d3cB97692eCB231A5D0e4A649Cb539d"}}, Currency: {SmartContract: {in: ["0xaaeE1A9723aaDB7afA2810263653A34bA2C21C7a","0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"]}}}
      orderBy: {descendingByField: "balance"}
  ) {
      Currency {
        Name
      }
      balance: sum(of: BalanceUpdate_Amount)
    }
  }
}


```

## Get the Buys, Sells, Buy Volume, Sell Volume and Makers

The query will fetch you the buys, sells, buy volume, sell volume and also the number of makers for a particular pair just like how DEXScreener shows in its UI. We are getting these trade metrics for this particular pool address `0xc2eaB7d33d3cB97692eCB231A5D0e4A649Cb539d`. You can check out the video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f052KzAsqnQ) to understand the query better.

You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Trade-metrics-just-like-dexscreener_4)

```
query MyQuery {
  EVM(network: eth, dataset: combined) {
    DEXTrades(
      limit: {count: 1}
      where: {Block: {Time: {since: "2024-05-29T09:15:00Z", till: "2024-05-30T09:15:00Z"}}, TransactionStatus: {Success: true}, Trade: {Dex: {Pair: {SmartContract: {is: "0xc2eaB7d33d3cB97692eCB231A5D0e4A649Cb539d"}}}}}
    ) {
      Makers: count(distinct: Transaction_From)
      buys: count(
        if: {Trade: {Sell: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0xaaeE1A9723aaDB7afA2810263653A34bA2C21C7a"}}}}}
      )
      buy_vol: sum(
        of: Trade_Buy_AmountInUSD
        if: {Trade: {Buy: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"}}}}}
      )
      sells: count(
        if: {Trade: {Buy: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0xaaeE1A9723aaDB7afA2810263653A34bA2C21C7a"}}}}}
      )
      sell_vol: sum(
        of: Trade_Sell_AmountInUSD
        if: {Trade: {Sell: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"}}}}}
      )
    }
  }
}
