# DEXTrades vs DEXTradesByTokens

### DEXTrades Cube

The **DEXTrades Cube** provides detailed information about decentralized exchange (DEX) trading data, focusing on the perspective of the pool involved in the trade. Here's a breakdown of its features:

- **Trade Perspective**: The data is presented from the pool's perspective. In every trade, one of the participants must be a pool, and the cube shows the pool's buy and sell details.
- **Buyer and Seller Identification**: The cube clearly differentiates the buyer and seller based on the pool's perspective. The poolâ€™s buy details include the currency bought by the pool, while the sell details include the currency sold by the pool.
- **Filtering**: Allows filtering of trades based on various criteria such as buy currency, sell currency, buyer, seller, DEX, pool, sender, receiver, transaction, time, etc.
- **Aggregation**: Supports aggregation of data based on time, amount, address, currency, type, buyer, seller, DEX, pool address, block time, etc.
- **Metrics**: Offers metrics for sum, count, average, median, maximum, minimum, etc., enabling comprehensive trade analysis.
