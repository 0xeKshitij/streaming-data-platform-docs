# Build Your Own NFT Portfolio Tracker with Bitquery NFT API - Begin Here

## What's the App?

The React app is designed for NFT creators who want to showcase their work in a portfolio format. With this app, creators can easily create a personalized portfolio page that displays their NFT collection, as well as information about their background and artistic process.

Users of the app can view each creator's collection of NFTs and learn more about their work by browsing through their portfolio. The app also provides links to purchase NFTs on OpenSea, a popular marketplace for buying and selling digital assets.

In addition to browsing and purchasing NFTs, users can also view the files associated with each NFT.
