# Building dApps with the Streaming API

The Streaming API is useful for a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps), including those that require real-time pricing, transaction data, token balances, and trading data and so on.

In this section let's see how we can incorporate the queries mentioned in the examples to build the following dApps.

-   Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that offer real-time pricing and transaction data to their users.
-   Wallets and portfolio trackers that can track token balances and transaction histories in real-time.
-   Trading bots and algorithmic trading platforms that rely on real-time market data to make informed trading decisions quickly.
-   NFT marketplaces that keep track of the latest ERC721 token transfers and metadata updates in real-time.
-   DeFi lending platforms that need to monitor collateral values and liquidation prices in real-time to ensure the stability of their protocols.
-   Gaming dApps that require real-time access to blockchain data to enable in-game transactions and NFT trading.
