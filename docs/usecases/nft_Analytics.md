# NFT Analytics


To implement a user-friendly interface for NFT analytics, you can follow these steps:

1.  Choose a suitable platform or framework to develop the interface. Some popular options for web development include React, Angular, and Vue.
    
2.  Use an NFT data provider like Bitquery to fetch NFT data such as sales volume, price, creator, and other relevant information.
    
3.  Design a user interface that is easy to navigate and intuitive to use. You can use tools like Figma or Sketch to create wireframes and mockups of the interface.
    
4.  Implement search and filtering functionality to allow users to search for NFTs based on various criteria such as sales volume, price, creator, and category. Bitquery's APIs can help you with that.

5.  Provide detailed information about each NFT, including its image, description, creator, sales history, and other relevant data.
    
6.  Add features to enable users to save, bookmark, or share their favorite NFTs.
    
7.  Ensure the interface is responsive and compatible with different devices and screen sizes.
    
8.  Test the interface thoroughly to ensure it is user-friendly and free of bugs or errors.
    

 ## Marketplace Analysis
 Bitquery's queries can help NFT marketplace builders analyze the performance of different NFTs on various blockchain networks. By providing real-time data on  transaction volume, and other key metrics, Bitquery can help builders optimize their marketplace's offerings and improve trading conditions for users.

## Price Analysis
 Bitquery's queries can help NFT marketplace builders monitor [NFT prices in real-time](https://ide.bitquery.io/latest-trades-for-a-MOONBIRDS-NFT---both-buy-and-sell), enabling them to identify trends and patterns. This can help builders make informed decisions when setting prices for NFTs and adjusting them in response to market changes.

## Transaction Monitoring 

Bitquery's queries can help NFT marketplace builders monitor and analyze transaction data on different blockchain networks. This can help them identify potential issues, such as failed transactions or delays, and take proactive measures to address them.

## Token Analysis
 One important feature for an NFT marketplace dApp is the ability to filter and search for NFTs based on various criteria such as the sales volume, price, artist, and category. This can help buyers and sellers find and evaluate NFTs based on their specific preferences and needs. Using the NFT API, developers can receive real-time updates on key filters like [NFT sales volume](https://ide.bitquery.io/NFT-Sales-Volume-on-Opensea). 

 ## Setting Up Subscriptions
Lastly, we also have the three [“subscribe”](https://ide.bitquery.io/Subscribe-to-Latest-MOONBIRDS-nft-transfers) functions of the dApp. These functions are important as they allow us to continuously update the dApp for our users in real-time whenever a transaction of digital collectibles occurs in the marketplace.
