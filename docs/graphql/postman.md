# Accessing Queries on Postman

You can run the queries and subscriptions on Postman as well. Below is the link to the collection:

[Postman Collection for Examples](https://www.postman.com/spacecraft-geologist-86385692/workspace/bitquery/collection/645e69d97aa179eb6799e1d6)

You can find examples for all chains in folders. Remember that token must be passed differently for a `query` vs a `subscription`. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/authorisation/how-to-use/)

>Remember that a websocket can be opened only on desktop version of Postman
