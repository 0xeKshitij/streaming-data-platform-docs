#  Use Metrics

Use metrics if you want to:

* calculate some statistics over the results
* aggregate the results in a smaller set

Adding metrics make the query aggregate query, and it will return
results, grouped by dimensions. Look [Query Aggregated Metrics](../capabilities/aggregated_metrics)
for details.

:::tip
Consider using metrics in every query to the [archive database](../dataset/archive)

:::note
Metrics can be also used in subscriptions, refer to [Subscription on Aggregated Metrics](../capabilities/subscription_aggregates) for details.
