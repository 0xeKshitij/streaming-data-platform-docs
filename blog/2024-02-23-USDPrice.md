# New Features

- We are excited to announce the introduction of USD pricing for V2 and EAP chains, a feature many of you have eagerly awaited. You can [query USD price](https://ide.bitquery.io/DEX-trades-on-Solana-wit-hUSD-Prie-on-both-sides) now as shown below.

```
subscription {
  Solana {
    DEXTrades(where: {
      Trade: {
        PriceAsymmetry: {
          le: 0.5
        }
      }
    }) {
      Block {
        Time
      }
      Trade {
        PriceAsymmetry
        Buy {
          Amount
          AmountInUSD
          PriceInUSD
          Currency {Symbol}
        }
        Sell {
          Amount
          AmountInUSD
          PriceInUSD
          Currency {Symbol}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Taking insights from our V1 APIs, we've introduced an improved price asymmetry metric to filter outliers on EAP chains. Read more [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/graphql/metrics/priceAsymmetry/)
